<h1 style="border-bottom: none;">Killer Features</h1>
<details>

* **Advanced Ray Tracing with Portal Support:** Seamlessly integrate portal interactions into your raycasts with `TracePlus.PortalBbox` (precise) and `TracePlus.PortalCheap` (fast). This game-changing feature opens up a world of possibilities for portal-based mechanics, previously unattainable with standard VScripts.

* **Optimized Bounding Box TraceCasting:** Perform highly efficient collision detection with `TracePlus.Bbox`, utilizing advanced techniques like segment-based search, entity filtering and caching, and optional binary refinement. This ensures smooth performance even in complex map scenarios.

* **Powerful `CBaseEntity` Wrapper:** The `pcapEntity` class, accessible through `entLib`, provides an extensive set of methods for manipulating entity properties, controlling animations, handling sounds, managing outputs and inputs, and much more. This dramatically simplifies entity scripting and allows for advanced entity control.

* **Asynchronous Event Scheduling:** The `ActionScheduler` module offers a robust event scheduling system with support for delayed actions, intervals, and asynchronous operations using the `yield` keyword. This allows for more flexible and responsive scripting compared to standard VScripts mechanisms.

* **Enhanced Data Structures:** Leverage powerful data structures like `ArrayEx`, `List`, and `AVLTree` from the `IDT` module to manage and manipulate data efficiently. These additions provide significant improvements over standard VScripts arrays and offer more flexibility for complex data handling.

* **Comprehensive Math Module:** Utilize a rich set of mathematical functions and objects, including quaternions (`Quaternion`), matrices (`Matrix`), linear interpolation (`lerp`), and easing functions (`ease`), for complex calculations and animations.

* **File Operations and Utilities:** Streamline file reading and writing with the `File` class and access various utility functions for tasks like logging, player hooks, portal management, and more.

* **Entity Script Animations:** Easily create smooth animations for entity alpha (opacity), color and etc. using functions like `AlphaTransition`, `ColorTransition`, `PositionTransition`... Real-time animation variants are also available for more dynamic control.

* **HUD Elements:** Create custom HUD elements like screen text (`ScreenText`) and instructor hints (`HintInstructor`) to provide feedback and guidance to players.

* **Physics Control:** Move VPhysics props with real forces using `PhysControl.Controller` - pull them to a point, drive them at a velocity or make them weightless, while they keep colliding with the world, pushing other props and keeping their momentum. Perfect for physguns, tractor beams and hover platforms.
