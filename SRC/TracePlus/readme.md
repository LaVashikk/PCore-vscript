## TracePlus/settings.nut

This file defines the `TracePlus.Settings` class, which encapsulates settings for ray traces, including options for entity filtering, model filtering, custom collision and ignore filters, and parameters for precise trace line analysis in the `BboxTraceAnalyzer` class. 

### TracePlus.Settings

This class stores various settings that control the behavior of traces, such as which entities and models to ignore, custom filter functions, and parameters for precise trace line analysis.

**Properties:**

    *   `ignoreClasses` (ArrayEx): An array of entity classnames to ignore during traces. Supports masks, e.g., `["trigger_"]` will ignore all entities with "trigger\_" in their classnames. **Supports Wildcard `"*"`: If present, ALL entities are ignored unless specified in `priorityClasses` (Whitelist mode).**
    *   `priorityClasses` (ArrayEx): An array of entity classnames to prioritize. **Entities in this list will ALWAYS be hit, overriding `ignoreClasses`. Use this to whitelist specific entities when `ignoreClasses` contains `"*"` or broad masks.**
    *   `ignoredModels` (ArrayEx): An array of entity model names to ignore during traces. Supports masks.
    *   `shouldRayHitEntity` (function or null): A custom function to determine if a ray should hit an entity. This function is used as a collision filter.
    *   `shouldIgnoreEntity` (function or null): A custom function to determine if an entity should be ignored during a trace. This function is used as an ignore filter.

**Methods:**

*   `new(settingsTable)`: Creates a new `TracePlus.Settings` object with default values or initializes it from a table of settings.
*   `SetIgnoredClasses(ignoreClassesArray)`: Sets the list of entity classnames to ignore during traces. **(Builder)**
*   `SetPriorityClasses(priorityClassesArray)`: Sets the list of entity classnames to prioritize during traces. **(Builder)**
*   `SetIgnoredModels(ignoredModelsArray)`: Sets the list of entity model names to ignore during traces. **(Builder)**
*   `AppendIgnoredClass(className)`: Appends an entity classname to the list of ignored classes. **(Builder)**
*   `AppendPriorityClasses(className)`: Appends an entity classname to the list of priority classes. **(Builder)**
*   `AppendIgnoredModel(modelName)`: Appends an entity model name to the list of ignored models. **(Builder)**
*   `SetCollisionFilter(filterFunction)`: Sets a custom function to determine if a ray should hit an entity (collision filter). **(Builder)**
*   `SetIgnoreFilter(filterFunction)`: Sets a custom function to determine if an entity should be ignored during a trace (ignore filter). **(Builder)**
*   `GetIgnoreClasses()`: Returns a copy of the list of entity classnames to ignore during traces. Change the list with the `Set`/`Append` methods.
*   `GetPriorityClasses()`: Returns a copy of the list of entity classnames to prioritize during traces. Change the list with the `Set`/`Append` methods.
*   `GetIgnoredModels()`: Returns a copy of the list of entity model names to ignore during traces. Change the list with the `Set`/`Append` methods.
*   `GetCollisionFilter()`: Returns the custom collision filter function.
*   `GetIgnoreFilter()`: Returns the custom ignore filter function.
*   `ApplyCollisionFilter(entity)`: Applies the custom collision filter function to an entity.
*   `ApplyIgnoreFilter(entity)`: Applies the custom ignore filter function to an entity.
*   `UpdateIgnoreEntities(ignoreEntities, newEnt)`: Updates the list of entities to ignore during a trace, including the player entity.

**Examples:**

**1. Creating `TracePlus.Settings` with specific settings using `new`:**

```js
local s = TracePlus.Settings.new({
    ignoreClasses = ArrayEx("trigger_multiple", "func_brush"),
}) 
```

**2. Creating `TracePlus.Settings` and setting properties with methods:**

```js
local s = TracePlus.Settings.new()
s.SetIgnoredClasses(["trigger_"])
s.AppendPriorityClasses("player")
```

**3. Using builder-style chained calls:**

```js
local s = TracePlus.Settings
    .SetIgnoredClasses(ArrayEx("trigger_multiple", "func_brush"))
    .AppendPriorityClasses("player")
```

## TracePlus/results.nut

This file defines classes representing the results of different types of traces, providing methods for accessing information about the trace and its outcome.

### CheapTraceResult

This class represents the result of a cheap (fast but less accurate) trace. It stores information about the trace, such as the start and end positions, hit position, hit fraction, and portal entry information.

**Properties:**

* `traceHandler` (table): The trace handler object containing trace information.
* `hitPos` (Vector): The hit position of the trace.
* `surfaceNormal` (Vector, optional): The impact normal of the surface hit by the trace (calculated on demand).
* `portalEntryInfo` (CheapTraceResult or null): Information about the portal the trace entered, if applicable.

**Methods:**

* `GetStartPos()`: Returns the start position of the trace as a Vector.
* `GetEndPos()`: Returns the end position of the trace as a Vector.
* `GetHitPos()`: Returns the hit position of the trace as a Vector.
* `GetFraction()`: Returns the fraction of the trace distance where the hit occurred (between 0 and 1).

* `GetImpactNormal()`: Calculates and returns the impact normal of the surface hit by the trace as a Vector.

**Example:**

```js
local startPos = Vector(0, 0, 0)
local endPos = Vector(100, 0, 0)
local traceResult = TracePlus.Cheap(startPos, endPos)

if (traceResult.DidHit()) {
    printl("Trace hit something at:" + traceResult.GetHitPos())
    local normal = traceResult.GetImpactNormal()
    // ... do something with the normal
}
```

### BboxTraceResult

This class represents the result of a bbox cast (trace with a bounding box). It extends the `CheapTraceResult` class and adds information about the hit entity and trace settings.

**Additional Properties:**

* `hitEnt` (CBaseEntity): The entity hit by the trace, or `null` if no entity was hit.

**Additional Methods:**

* `GetEntity()`: Returns the hit entity as a `pcapEntity` object, or `null` if no entity was hit.

if (traceResult.DidHit()) {
    local hitEntity = traceResult.GetEntity()
if (hitEntity) {
    printl("Trace hit entity:" + hitEntity.GetClassname())
} else {
    printl("Trace hit the world.")
}
}
```

## TracePlus/cheap\_trace.nut

This file provides functions for performing cheap (fast but less accurate) traces.

### TracePlus.Cheap(startPos, endPos)

This function performs a cheap trace from the specified start and end positions. It uses the standard `TraceLine` function internally but returns a `CheapTraceResult` object with additional information.

**Parameters:**

* `startPos` (Vector): The start position of the trace.
* `endPos` (Vector): The end position of the trace.

**Returns:**

* (CheapTraceResult): The trace result object.

**Example:**

```js
local traceResult = TracePlus.Cheap(startPos, endPos)
if (traceResult.DidHit()) {
    // ...
}
```

### TracePlus.FromEyes.Cheap(distance, player)

This function performs a cheap trace from the player's eyes in the direction they are looking.

**Parameters:**

* `distance` (number): The distance of the trace.
* `player` (CBaseEntity or pcapEntity): The player entity.

**Returns:**

* (CheapTraceResult): The trace result object.

**Example:**

```js
local player = GetPlayerEx()
local traceResult = TracePlus.FromEyes.Cheap(100, player) // Trace 100 units in front of the player
```

## TracePlus/bboxcast.nut

This file provides functions for performing bbox casts (traces with bounding boxes).

### TracePlus.Bbox(startPos, endPos, ignoreEntities, settings)

This function performs a bbox cast from the specified start and end positions. It uses a more precise algorithm than `TraceLine` to check for collisions with entities' bounding boxes.

**Parameters:**

* `startPos` (Vector): The start position of the trace.
* `endPos` (Vector): The end position of the trace.
* `ignoreEntities` (array, CBaseEntity, or null, optional): A list of entities or a single entity to ignore during the trace.
* `settings` (TraceSettings, optional): The settings to use for the trace (defaults to `TracePlus.defaultSettings`).
* `insideTestPos` (Vector or null, optional): Entities whose bounding box contains this point are skipped for the whole trace (defaults to `startPos`). `TracePlus.PortalBbox` passes a point just behind the exit portal here, so objects resting on the exit portal are still hit.

**Returns:**

* (BboxTraceResult): The trace result object.

**Example:**

```js
local traceResult = TracePlus.Bbox(startPos, endPos, ignoreEntities, traceSettings)
if (traceResult.DidHit()) {
    // ...
}
```

### TracePlus.FromEyes.Bbox(distance, player, ignoreEntities, settings)

This function performs a bbox cast from the player's eyes in the direction they are looking.

**Parameters:**

* `distance` (number): The distance of the trace.
* `player` (CBaseEntity or pcapEntity): The player entity.
* `ignoreEntities` (array, CBaseEntity, or null, optional): A list of entities or a single entity to ignore during the trace.
* `settings` (TraceSettings, optional): The settings to use for the trace (defaults to `TracePlus.defaultSettings`).

**Returns:**

* (BboxTraceResult): The trace result object.

**Example:**

```js
local traceResult = TracePlus.FromEyes.Bbox(100, player, ignoreEntities)
if (traceResult.DidHit()) {
    // ...
}
```


## [Portal Castings - How to Use](#portal-castings---how-to-use)

To ensure the correct functionality of portal casting, it's crucial to follow these guidelines:

### [`prop_portal`](#prop_portal)

If `prop_portal` is created manually and has a non-zero `paidId`, you need to add the keyvalue `health` with a value matching the `paidId`. This is necessary for more accurate partner portal detection.

todo: add photo

### [`linked_portal_door`](#linked_portal_door)

For correct operation, you need to create the keyvalue `model` with the portal's `width height` values. For example: `128 64`. The `model` keyvalue is used by the `TracePlus` module to calculate the bounding box of the portal.

todo: add photo

### [Disabling Portals](#disabling-portals)

* To correctly disable portals for a `pcapEntity` portal, you need to call the `SetTraceIgnore` method. You can achieve this by adding the `OnUser1` output to the portal entity and connecting it to a script that calls `SetTraceIgnore`.

todo: add photo

**Alternatively, you can automate this process using the `func_portal_detector` entity on your map.** This entity can detect when a portal is opened or closed and automatically trigger the appropriate script to enable or disable the portal for tracing.

**Note:**
* For advanced scenarios, you can create custom filter functions for `TracePlus.Settings` to define specific rules for ray tracing collisions and entity ignoring.

## TracePlus/calculate\_normal.nut

This file provides functions for calculating the impact normal of a surface hit by a trace. It offers distinct algorithms to address different scenarios, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency in determining the surface orientation at the hit point.

### Global Functions:

*   **`CalculateImpactNormal(startPos, hitPos)`:**
    Calculates the impact normal of a surface hit by a trace, primarily for world geometry. It utilizes the "three-ray method" to determine the surface orientation. This method involves performing three cheap traces - one from the original hit position and two from slightly offset positions - to create a triangle. The normal of this triangle represents the surface normal. This approach is efficient but might not be suitable for dynamic entities.
    
*   **`CalculateImpactNormalFromBbox(startPos, hitPos, hitEntity)`:**
    Calculates the impact normal of a surface for dynamic entities, utilizing the hit entity's bounding box. It employs an optimized algorithm that assumes one of the hit point's coordinates is shared by at least four vertices of the bounding box. This assumption allows for efficient identification of the hit face and calculation of its normal.
    
**Impact Normal Calculation Algorithms:**

A detailed description of the algorithms used in `calculate_normal.nut`, including their steps, limitations, and considerations, can be found in the [calculate\_normal.md](calculate_normal.md) file.
